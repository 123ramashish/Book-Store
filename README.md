This project is called the Book-Store project, and it was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface. 
On the backend, we utilized Node.js, Express.js, and various npm packages to manage and control the application's functionality dynamically.
The project was designed following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, which helps in organizing code for better maintainability and scalability.

In this project, Express.js routes were implemented to handle all the different links and paths within the application. 
These routes were responsible for enabling functionalities such as adding new books, updating existing ones, and deleting entries from the store. 
All of these operations were performed dynamically using JavaScript functions, which were integrated into the frontend interface to provide a seamless user experience.

Data management in the Book-Store project was handled by storing information about books in an array. 
However, it's worth noting that this data storage method is volatile, meaning that the data is not persisted beyond the duration of the application's runtime. 
As a result, any changes made to the book inventory during a session would not be retained once the application is closed.

This project served as a practical learning experience during the exploration of Node.js, Express.js, and the utilization of third-party npm modules.
Through hands-on development, concepts such as routing, middleware integration, and backend data manipulation were solidified, contributing to a deeper understanding of full-stack web development.
